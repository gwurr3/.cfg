#                     A hotkey is written according to the following rules:
#
#                       hotkey   = <keysym> ':' <command> |
#                                  <keysym> '->' ':' <command>
#
#                       keysym   = <mod> '-' <key> | <key>
#
#                       mod      = 'built-in mod keyword' | <mod> '+' <mod>
#
#                       key      = <literal> | <keycode>
#
#                       literal  = 'single letter or built-in keyword'
#
#                       keycode  = 'apple keyboard kVK_<Key> values (0x3C)'
#
#                       ->       = keypress is not consumed by skhd
#
#                       command  = command is executed through '$SHELL -c' and
#                                  follows valid shell syntax. if the $SHELL environment
#                                  variable is not set, it will default to '/bin/bash'.
#                                  when bash is used, the ';' delimeter can be specified
#                                  to chain commands.
#
#                                  to allow a command to extend into multiple lines,
#                                  prepend '\' at the end of the previous line.
#
#                                  an EOL character signifies the end of the bind.
